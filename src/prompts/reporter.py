Based on the information gathered, here is the comprehensive response to the query:
"The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which causes shorter wavelengths of 
light (blue) to scatter more than longer wavelengths (red) [1]. This scattering causes the sky to look blue most of 
the time [1]. Additionally, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the light has to 
pass through more atmosphere, scattering the shorter blue wavelengths out of the line of sight and allowing the 
longer red wavelengths to dominate [2]."
